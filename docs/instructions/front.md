1. Prep the front panel. We had to add some holes post manufacturing, but if you follow the included drawings and drill positions, your plate will arrive from DataPro compeletely ready.

5. Wire the HDMI cables up to the Raspberry Pi and secure them with small cable ties. HDMI 0 goes to the LCD touchscreens and HDMI 1 goes to the plate mounted HDMI pass through.

7. While working on the panel, we recommend installing a piece of foam over touchscreens to prevent them from being scratched.
