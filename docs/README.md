# Cyberdeck
A custom build of Kali Linux Raspberry Pi’s, fun little radios, all packaged in a portable Pelican case.

### Why

Very good question. Why not? 🤷‍♂️

While many people would have varying uses for a project like this, here's a few I can personally offer:

* I had accumulated over the years a lot of interesting little boards (SDR, Ubertooth One, etc) and wanted to have them all put together in one place and be more usable.

* It was a great distraction over the 2025 holidays and gave me a much needed mental break from work.

* I'll occasionally get some professional use out of it when working on IoT projects, being able to inspect raw radio packets, etc.

* It's a lot of fun on the weekends to sit and listen to various radio traffic out there - Fire, EMS, Police, Air Traffic, etc.

* In a natural disaster, civil unrest, etc where we could possibly lose cellular and internet access - it could become quite useful to get comms up with the outside world.

* Lets face it, between the radios in the project and capabilities of Kali Linux, this is a giant rabbit hole of learning. I love to learn new things, and this will bring years of enjoyment.

### Parts

* A complete bill of materials can be found [here](https://github.com/jagould2012/cyberdeck/blob/main/bom.csv) for the project.
* The optional stand bill of materials is [here](https://github.com/jagould2012/cyberdeck/blob/main/stand.bom.csv).

### Cost

While many enthusiasts have a lot of these parts laying around from previous projects (Raspberry Pi, power supplies, assorted cables), if you were to start from scratch and order each item, the cost of the materials is about $3400. The optional stand is about $150 to build.
